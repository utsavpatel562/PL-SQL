## Introduction

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. This repository includes a set of scripts written in PL/SQL to help beginners understand and practice fundamental programming concepts.

## Files in the Repository

Here are the scripts included in this repository:

1. **Fibonacci.sql**: 
   - Contains two implementations for generating Fibonacci series:
     - Using a FOR loop.
     - Using a WHILE loop.

2. **Palindrome_number.sql**:
   - Checks if a given number is a palindrome.

3. **Reverse_for_loop.sql**:
   - Demonstrates reversing a sequence of numbers using a FOR loop.

4. **Factorial_using_while_loop.sql**:
   - Calculates the factorial of a given number using a WHILE loop.

5. **Odd_Even.sql**:
   - Determines if a given number is odd or even.

6. **Leap_Year_or_Not.sql**:
   - Checks if a given year is a leap year or not.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you will need access to an Oracle database and a tool that can execute PL/SQL scripts, such as SQL*Plus, SQL Developer, or any other PL/SQL IDE.

### Running the Scripts

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utsavpatel562/PL-SQL.git
   cd PL-SQL
